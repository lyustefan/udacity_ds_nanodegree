    "Let's say that we've collected data for a web-based experiment. In the experiment, we're testing the change in layout of a product information page to see if this affects the proportion of people who click on a button to go to the download page. This experiment has been designed to have a cookie-based diversion, and we record two things from each user: which page version they received, and whether or not they accessed the download page during the data recording period. (We aren't keeping track of any other factors in this example, such as number of pageviews, or time between accessing the page and making the download, that might be of further interest.)\n",
