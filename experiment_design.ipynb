No control is exerted on the variable interest, perhaps due to **ethical concerns** or a **lack of power to enact the manipulation**.

Conclusion needs to be drawn by comparing existing smoking and non-smoking groups.\n",

However, there might be other reason for the change, users might gravitated to higher usage regardless of change in user interface.\n",

Don't forget that, since we have a two-sided test, an extreme case also includes values on the opposite side of 50/50. (e.g. Since simulated outcomes of .48 and lower are considered as being more extreme than an actual observation of 0.48, so too will simulated outcomes of .52 and higher.)

    "After performing our checks on the invariant metric, we can move on to performing a hypothesis test on the evaluation metric: the click-through rate. In this case, we want to see that the experimental group has a significantly larger click-through rate than the control group, a one-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation approach for this metric isn't too different from the approach for the invariant metric. You'll need the overall click-through rate as the common proportion to draw simulated values from for each group. You may also want to perform more simulations since there's higher variance for this test.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a few analytic approaches possible here, but you'll probably make use of the normal approximation again in these cases. In addition to the pooled click-through rate, you'll need a pooled standard deviation in order to compute a z-score. While there is a continuity correction possible in this case as well, it's much more conservative than the p-value that a simulation will usually imply. Computing the z-score and resulting p-value without a continuity correction should be closer to the simulation's outcomes, though slightly more optimistic about there being a statistical difference between groups."

    "\n",
    "One way we could solve this is through trial and error. Every sample size will have a level of power associated with it; testing multiple sample sizes will gradually allow us to narrow down the minimum sample size required to obtain our desired power level. This isn't a particularly efficient method, but it can provide an intuition for how experiment sizing works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the `power()` function below following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Under the null hypothesis, we should have a critical value for which the Type I error rate is at our desired alpha level.\n",
    "  - `se_null`: Compute the standard deviation for the difference in proportions under the null hypothesis for our two groups. The base probability is given by `p_null`. Remember that the variance of the difference distribution is the sum of the variances for the individual distributions, and that _each_ group is assigned `n` observations.\n",
    "  - `null_dist`: To assist in re-use, this should be a [scipy norm object](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.html). Specify the center and standard deviation of the normal distribution using the \"loc\" and \"scale\" arguments, respectively.\n",
    "  - `p_crit`: Compute the critical value of the distribution that would cause us to reject the null hypothesis. One of the methods of the `null_dist` object will help you obtain this value (passing in some function of our desired error rate `alpha`).\n",
    "2. The power is the proportion of the distribution under the alternative hypothesis that is past that previously-obtained critical value.\n",
    "  - `se_alt`: Now it's time to make computations in the other direction. This will be standard deviation of differences under the desired detectable difference. Note that the individual distributions will have different variances now: one with `p_null` probability of success, and the other with `p_alt` probability of success.\n",
    "  - `alt_dist`: This will be a scipy norm object like above. Be careful of the \"loc\" argument in this one. The way the `power` function is set up, it expects `p_alt` to be greater than `p_null`, for a positive difference.\n",
    "  - `beta`: Beta is the probability of a Type-II error, or the probability of failing to reject the null for a particular non-null state. That means you should make use of `alt_dist` and `p_crit` here!"

    "#### Method 2: Analytic Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've got some intuition for power by using trial and error, we can now approach a closed-form solution for computing a minimum experiment size. The key point to notice is that, for an $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ both < .5, the critical value for determining statistical significance will fall between our null click-through rate and our alternative, desired click-through rate. So, the difference between $p_0$ and $p_1$ can be subdivided into the distance from $p_0$ to the critical value $p^*$ and the distance from $p^*$ to $p_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src= './img/expsize_power.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Those subdivisions can be expressed in terms of the standard error and the z-scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p^* - p_0 = z_{1-\\alpha} SE_{0},$$\n",
    "$$p_1 - p^* = -z_{\\beta} SE_{1};$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_1 - p_0 = z_{1-\\alpha} SE_{0} - z_{\\beta} SE_{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In turn, the standard errors can be expressed in terms of the standard deviations of the distributions, divided by the square root of the number of samples in each group:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SE_{0} = \\frac{s_{0}}{\\sqrt{n}},$$\n",
    "$$SE_{1} = \\frac{s_{1}}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting these values in and solving for $n$ will give us a formula for computing a minimum sample size to detect a specified difference, at the desired level of power:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n = \\lceil \\big(\\frac{z_{\\alpha} s_{0} - z_{\\beta} s_{1}}{p_1 - p_0}\\big)^2 \\rceil$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lceil ... \\rceil$ represents the ceiling function, rounding up decimal values to the next-higher integer. Implement the necessary variables in the function below, and test them with the cells that follow."

    "The example explored above is a one-tailed test, with the alternative value greater than the null. The power computations performed in the first part will _not_ work if the alternative proportion is **less** than the null, e.g. detecting a proportion parameter of 0.88 against a null of 0.9. You might want to try to rewrite the code to handle that case! The same issue should not show up for the second approach, where we directly compute the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find that you need to do a two-tailed test, you should pay attention to two main things. First of all, the \"alpha\" parameter needs to account for the fact that the rejection region is divided into two areas. Secondly, you should perform the computation based on the worst-case scenario, the alternative case with the highest variability. Since, for the binomial, variance is highest when $p = .5$, decreasing as $p$ approaches 0 or 1, you should choose the alternative value that is closest to .5 as your reference when computing the necessary sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note as well that the above methods **only** perform sizing for _statistical significance_, and do not take into account _practical significance_. One thing to realize is that if the true size of the experimental effect is the same as the desired practical significance level, then it's a coin flip whether the mean will be above or below the practical significance bound. This also doesn't even consider how a confidence interval might interact with that bound. In a way, experiment sizing is a way of checking on whether or not you'll be able to get what you _want_ from running an experiment, rather than checking if you'll get what you _need_."

    "### Alternative Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also tools and Python packages that can also help with sample sizing decisions, so you don't need to solve for every case on your own. The sample size calculator [here](http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html) is applicable for proportions, and provides the same results as the methods explored above. (Note that the calculator assumes a two-tailed test, however.) Python package \"statsmodels\" has a number of functions in its [`power` module](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/stats.html#power-and-sample-size-calculations) that perform power and sample size calculations. Unlike previously shown methods, differences between null and alternative are parameterized as an effect size (standardized difference between group means divided by the standard deviation). Thus, we can use these functions for more than just tests of proportions. If we want to do the same tests as before, the [`proportion_effectsize`](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportion_effectsize.html) function computes [Cohen's h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_h) as a measure of effect size. As a result, the output of the statsmodel functions will be different from the result expected above. This shouldn't be a major concern since in most cases, you're not going to be stopping based on an exact number of observations. You'll just use the value to make general design decisions."

    "#### Bootstrapping\n",
    "Bootstrapping is used to estimate sampling distributions by using the actually collected data to generate new samples that could have been hypothetically collected. In a standard bootstrap, a bootstrapped sample means drawing points from the original data _with replacement_ until we get as many points as there were in the original data. Essentially, we're treating the original data as the population: without making assumptions about the original population distribution, using the original data as a model of the population is the best that we can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a lot of bootstrapped samples allows us to estimate the sampling distribution for various statistics on our original data. For example, let's say that we wanted to create a 95% confidence interval for the 90th percentile from a dataset of 5000 data points. (Perhaps we're looking at website load times and want to reduce the worst cases.) Bootstrapping makes this easy to estimate. First of all, we take a bootstrap sample (i.e., draw 5000 points with replacement from the original data), record the 90th percentile, and then repeat this a large number of times, let's say 100 000. From this bunch of bootstrapped 90th percentile estimates, we form our confidence interval by finding the values that capture the central 95% of the estimates (cutting off 2.5% on each tail). Implement this operation in the cells below, using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize some useful variables by storing the number of data points in `n_points` and setting up an empty list for the bootstrapped quantile values in `sample_qs`.\n",
    "- Create a loop for each trial:\n",
    "  - First generate a bootstrap sample by sampling from our data with replacement. ([`random.choice`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) will be useful here.)\n",
    "  - Then, compute the `q`th quantile of the sample and add it to the `sample_qs` list. If you're using NumPy v0.15 or later, you can use the [`quantile`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.quantile.html) function to get the quantile directly with `q`; on v0.14 or earlier, you'll need to put `q` in terms of a percentile and use [`percentile`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.percentile.html) instead.\n",
    "- After gathering the bootstrapped quantiles, find the limits that capture the central `c` proportion of quantiles to form the estimated confidence interval."

    "* Bootstrapping Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals coming from the bootstrap procedure will be optimistic compared to the true state of the world. This is because there will be things that we don't know about the real world that we can't account for, due to not having a parametric model of the world's state. Consider the extreme case of trying to understand the distribution of the maximum value: our confidence interval would never be able to include any value greater than the largest observed value and it makes no sense to have any lower bound below the maximum observation. Intuitively, however, there's a pretty clear possibility for there to be unobserved values that are larger than the one we've observed, especially for skewed data like shown in the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't override the bootstrap method's advantages, however. The bootstrap procedure is fairly simple and straightforward. Since you don't make assumptions about the distribution of data, it can be applicable for any case you encounter. The results should also be fairly comparable to standard tests. But it does take computational effort, and its output does depend on the data put in. For reference, for the 95% CI on the 90th percentile example explored above, the inferred interval would only capture about 83% of 90th percentiles from the original generating distribution. But a more intricate procedure using a binomial assumption to index on the observed data only does about one percentage point better (84%). And both of these depend on the specific data generated: a different set of 5000 points will produce different intervals, with different accuracies.\n",

    "#### Permutation Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The permutation test is a resampling-type test used to compare the values on an outcome variable between two or more groups. In the case of the permutation test, resampling is done on the group labels. The idea here is that, under the null hypothesis, the outcome distribution should be the same for all groups, whether control or experimental. Thus, we can emulate the null by taking all of the data values as a single large group. Applying labels randomly to the data points (while maintaining the original group membership ratios) gives us one simulated outcome from the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest follows similar to the sampling approach to a standard hypothesis test, except that we haven't specified a reference distribution to sample from – we're sampling directly from the data we've collected. After applying the labels randomly to all the data and recording the outcome statistic many times, we compare our actual, observed statistic against the simulated statistics. A p-value is obtained by seeing how many simulated statistic values are as or more extreme as the one actually observed, and a conclusion is then drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try implementing a permutation test in the cells below to test if the 90th percentile of times is staistically significantly smaller for the experimental group, as compared to the control group:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize an empty list to store the difference in sample quantiles as `sample_diffs`.\n",
    "- Create a loop for each trial where:\n",
    "  - First generate a permutation sample by randomly shuffling the data point labels. ([`random.permutation`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.permutation.html) will be useful here.)\n",
    "  - Then, compute the `q`th quantile of the data points that have been assigned to each group based on the permuted labels. Append the difference in quantiles to the `sample_diffs` list.\n",
    "- After gathering the quantile differences for permuted samples, compute the observed difference for the actual data. Then, compute a p-value from the number of permuted sample differences that are less than or greater than the observed difference, depending on the desired alternative hypothesis."

    "#### Rank sum test\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank-sum test is fairly different from the two previous approaches. There's no resamplng involved; the test is performed only on the data present. The rank-sum test, also known as the Mann-Whitney U test, is not a test of any particular statistic, like the mean or median. Instead, it's a test of distributions: let's say we draw one value at random from the populations behind each group. The null hypothesis says that there's an equal chance that the larger value is from the first group as the second group; the alternative hypothesis says that there's an unequal chance, which can be specified as one- or two-tailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test this hypothesis, we should look at the data we've collected and see in how many cases values from one group win compared to values in the second. That is, for each data point in the first group, we count how many values in the second group that are smaller than it. (If both values are equal, we count that as a tie, worth +0.5 to the tally.) This number of wins for the first group gives us a value $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that $U$ is approximately normally-distributed, given a large enough sample size. If we have $n_1$ data points in the first group and $n_2$ points in the second, then we have a total of $n_1 n_2$ matchups and an equivalent number of victory points to hand out. Under the null hypothesis, we should expect the number of wins to be evenly distributed between groups, and so the expected wins are $\\mu_U = \\frac{n_1 n_2}{2}$. The variability in the number of wins can be found to be the following equation (assuming no or few ties):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\sigma_U = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_1n_2(n_1+n_2+1)}{12}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These $\\mu_U$ and $\\sigma_U$ values can then be used to compute a standard normal z-score, which generates a p-value. Implement this method of performing the rank-sum test in the cells below!\n",
    "\n",
    "- HINT: scipy stats' [`norm`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.html) class can be used to obtain p-values after computing a z-score."

    "Also, there already exists a function in the scipy stats package [`mannwhitneyu`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu.html) that performs the Mann Whitney U test. This function considers more factors than the implementation above, including a correction on the standard deviation for ties and a continuity correction (since we're approximating a discretely-valued distribution with a continuous one). In addition, the approach they take is computationally more efficient, based on the sum of value ranks (hence the rank-sum test name) rather than the matchups explanation provided above.\n",

    "The sign test also only uses the collected data to compute a test result. It only requires that there be paired values between two groups to compare, and tests whether one group's values tend to be higher than the other's.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sign test, we don't care how large differences are between groups, only which group takes a larger value. So a comparison of 0.21 vs. 0.22 and 0.21 vs. 0.31 are both counted equally as a point in favor of the second group. This makes the sign test a fairly weak test, though also a test that can be applied fairly broadly. It's most useful when we have very few observations to draw from and can't make a good assumption of underlying distribution characteristics. For example, you might use a sign test as an additional check on click rates that have been aggregated on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The count of victories for a particular group can be modeled with the binomial distribution. Under the null hypothesis, it is equally likely that either group has a larger value (in the case of a tie, we ignore the comparison): the binomial distribution's success parameter is $p = 0.5$. Implement the sign test in the function below!\n",
